📚 Book Recommendation Backend - Python

HOW TO RUN:
1. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Open terminal / command prompt inside this folder.
3. Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Then run the script using:
   python hybrid_book_recommender.py

📁 Data Files:
- Place Books.csv and Ratings.csv inside the 'book_data' folder.

🧠 Output:
- Recommends 5 random books based on hybrid filtering (ALS + TF-IDF).
- Sample recommendations will be printed in the terminal.

Let me know if you want me to expose this as an API later.

Thanks!
